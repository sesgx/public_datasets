      "abstract": "Any process improvement program should be driven by and related to some set of business or overarching organizational needs. By considering change drivers in concert with the organization strategic objectives and \"pains\" one can develop a vision of the desired state, what the organization should look like and how it should behave after the desired changes are achieved. An appropriate reference model is then chosen and used in an assessment to identify improvement opportunities. Based on the assessment findings an action plan is developed and implemented which addresses both specific process changes and organization cultural issues. Finally, an appropriate set of measures is defined and implemented to help measure the effects of the various changes.",

      "title": "SPI: 'I can't get no satisfaction' - Directing process improvement to meet business needs",
      "abstract": "IT managers commonly complain of lack of resources for Software Process Improvement (SPI) projects. The authors postulate that this comes from lack of understanding by the company board of the benefit of SPI, and perhaps a lack of understanding by IT managers of the needs of the company board? So how can IT managers obtain satisfaction? A shortcoming of the ISO-9001 and the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) approaches to process improvement (in software production) is the lack of explicit connection to the business goals of the organization in question. In the eyes of business management, therefore, these models appear to represent an \u2018idealized\u2019 view of the world. A negative assessment against such a model is insufficient, in itself, to justify significant expenditure on an improvement plan. While a standardized model is invaluable as a common reference for measurement and comparison, the initiation of a meaningful improvement plan requires investment of money and allocation of resources; and that can only take place if current business goals, not an \u2018ideal\u2019 model, are the motivating force. The draft SPICE method has recognized this need. It proposes the comparison of an assessed capability profile with a target capability profile. However the current draft standard (version 2.0) contains little guidance on how to arrive at such a target capability profile. This paper describes a method for drawing up such a target capability profile. To preserve clarity, we have placed the description of our method in the context of a SPICE assessment and process improvement, but the method would also be suitable for use with ISO, CMM, ITIL or other process models.1 In all cases an improvement plan can be set up which is visibly geared to the business goals.",

As a follow-up of a previous paper on SPI for the CMM using Quality Function Deployment (QFD), a new SPI framework integrating QFD with the CMMI is developed. Similar to the earlier SPI framework for the CMM, the proposed SPI framework based on the CMMI using QFD aims to achieve three objectives: (1) to map process requirements, including business requirements, to the CMMI with the help of QFD; (2) to develop a method based on QFD for the integration and prioritization of requirements from multiple perspectives (groups); and (3) to be able to prioritize software process improvement actions based on process requirements. Process requirements from multiples groups of stakeholders (perspectives), including business goals, are integrated and prioritized. SPI actions are linked to these process requirements using QFD. Thus, the priorities of actions reflect the priorities of process requirements. By executing the actions with the highest priorities, the highest satisfaction level of process requirements can be achieved. One unique feature of the framework for the CMMI Continuous representation is that the priority values of these actions can be compared across PAs, even when the PAs attempt to reach different capability levels.",

Interfacing these technologies appears especially appropriate and timely. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 strives to make federal agencies operate more like businesses by requiring strategic plans and conducting performance audits. Process modeling technology aimed at providing assistance for the integrated product and process development (IPPD) approach for system development is being developed. In today's environment of perpetual change, a means of effectively predicting the impact of such changes on system development would be valuable. System dynamics modeling provides promise in this area. Since the product of strategic planning can be viewed as improved business and operational processes that will likely undergo major changes in response to events occurring in today's environment, there appears to be a natural synergy between application of these three technologies. The paper addresses exploitation of this natural synergy and hypothesizes that such exploitation would facilitate the development and operation of complex systems over the entire life cycle.",

This book provides guidance on how to achieve this alignment, how to monitor the success of goals and strategies and use measurement to recognize potential failures, and how to close alignment gaps. It uses the GQM+Strategies approach, which provides concepts and actionable steps for creating the link between goals and strategies across an organization and allows for measurement-based decision-making. After outlining the general motivation for organizational alignment through measurement, the GQM+Strategies approach is described concisely, with a focus on the basic model that is created and the process for creating and using this model. The recommended steps of all six phases of the process are then described in detail with the help of a comprehensive application example. Finally, the industrial challenges addressed by the method and cases of its application in industry are presented, and the relations to other approaches, such as Balanced Scorecard, are described. The book concludes with supplementary material, such as checklists and guidelines, to support the application of the method. This book is aimed at organization leaders, managers, decision makers, and other professionals interested in aligning their organization\u2019s goals and strategies and establishing an efficient strategic measurement program.

However, the adoption of these improvements on software organizations must be aligned to their strategic goals. Otherwise, these improvements may not improve the organization. However, to guarantee this alignment can be complex, since improvement initiatives would have to be planned and monitored considering aspects starting from strategic level and going all the way to the organization daily operations. Thus, this work presents an approach to define and monitor software improvement goals, which are decompositions of strategic goals and are related to software products or processes. Our approach comprises strategic, tactical and operational planning activities, always aiming at strategic alignment.

Although many software development organisations have adopted improvement models such as CMMI, it appears to be difficult to improve software development processes in the right way, e.g. tuned to the actual needs of the organisation. This paper presents a new approach to determine the direction of improvement for an organisation. This approach is based on an elaboration of the concept of entropy. The approach is empirically validated by carrying out interviews in 11 software development organisations in The Netherlands. The results of the research show that software development organisations can be classified and can be positioned on the basis of their internal and external entropy, c.q. the level of (dis)order in the business system and its environment. Based on a possible out-of-balance situation between the internal and external entropy, directions for software process improvement can be discussed. As such the proposed approach can support the application of current software process improvement methodologies such as the CMMI.",

A method for identifying the major factors affecting a process-improvement goal and how the perception of the importance of the factors varies throughout the organisation are described The method lets individuals from the whole development organisation rate the expected effect of these factors from their own viewpoint. In this way the strategic SPI decision can be taken using input from the entire organisation, and any discrepancies in the ratings can also give important SPI- decision information. The method is applied to a case study performed at Fuji Xerox, Tokyo. In the case study, significantly different profiles of the factor ratings came from management compared with those from the engineering staff.

However, many such organizations suffer from processes that do not fit their demands, either because they do not provide the necessary support, or because they provide features that are no longer necessary. This leads to unnecessary costs during the development cycle, a phenomenon that worsens over time. This paper presents the SCOPE approach for systematically determining the process demands of current and future products and projects, for analyzing existing processes aimed at satisfying these demands, and for subsequently selecting those processes that provide the most benefit for the organization. The validation showed that SCOPE is capable of adjusting an organization\u2019s process scope in such a way that the most suitable processes are kept and the least suitable ones can be discarded.",
